The CMAC algorithm is designed using 35 weights, which are trained to get a desired results.
The data set of 100 points is collected from a sine curve, from which 30 of them chosoen randomly are assigned for testing and remaining 70 are for training.
The no.of times the CMAC weight vector is trained depends on how desired the output is.
As there are 70 training as 35 weights, each weight corresponds to two of the training data. That is for every two adjacent input training data we update the same vector.
